function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
% This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement
% Inputs n is the number of rows, and m the number of columns
% It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice
A = zeros(n,m); 
if nargin('specialMatrix')~=2
    error('input exactly two arguments') %error
end

% Now the real challenge is to fill in the correct values of A
for r = 1:n 
    for p = 1:m
        if r==1
            A(r,p)=p
        elseif p==1
            A(r,p)=r;
        else
            A(r,p)=A(r-1,p)+A(r,p-1);
        end
    end
   

end
% Things beyond here are outside of your function
